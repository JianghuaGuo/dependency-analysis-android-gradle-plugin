Dependency Analysis Plugin Changelog

# Version 0.39.0 (unreleased)
* [New] Reports when kapt has been applied but there are no annotation processors present.
* [New] Reports when either the `java-library` or `org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm` have been redundantly
applied. Laid the groundwork for reporting other plugin issues.
* [Fixed] Reports unused dependencies that are on a flavor-based configuration as being on a "null"
configuration.
* Re-organized the model code. In particular, moved `Advice` and `Dependency` to a non-internal
package. These should now be considered part of the plugin's public API.
* Added an "intermediates" directory to the output, so it's more clear to end-users which files
they should care about.

# Version 0.38.0
* [Fixed] Plugin now correctly detects usage of annotation processors that support annotations with
`SOURCE` retention policies.
* Updated asm dependency to 8.0.1 (shaded).

# Version 0.37.0
Please note that this version is only available via Maven Central, as there were issues publishing 
to the Gradle Plugin Portal.
* [New] Support kotlin-jvm projects.
* [Fixed] False positive on unused annotation processors.
* [Fixed] Poor performance in `MisusedDependencyDetector`. (special thanks to Stephane Nicolas 
@stephanenicolas for discussing this issue with me)

# Version 0.36.0
* [New] Reports unused annotation processors.
* [New] Tries to be more memory-efficient by interning strings.
* [New] Tries to be more memory-efficient by using in-memory cache to avoid duplicate (simultaneous) work.
* [New] No longer fails when used outside of known-good AGP range. Instead emits warning.
* [New] New extension method `chatty()` lets users set console logging preference.
* [Fixed] Don't use default Locale when capitalizing strings. 

# Version 0.35.0
* [Fixed] Plugin gives redundant advice (suggests moving compileOnly dep to compileOnly). This impacted both
console output and advice.json.
* Plugin no longer eagerly fails if a version of AGP is used outside of the known-good range.
Instead it emits a warning.

# Version 0.34.0
* [Fixed] Check for presence of ContentProvider or Service in contributed Android manifests.
Such Android libraries are now considered used, even if they don't appear in the compiled classes of a project.
(nb: this ensures LeakCanary is not considered unused.)
* [Fixed] Reports appcompat as unused when its resources are (but not by Java/Kotlin source).
* [Fixed] Deprecation warning with AGP 4+ for `android.viewBinding` and `android.dataBinding`.
Fixed issue with `AgpVersion` comparisons.

# Version 0.33.0
* Added extension option for ignoring "-ktx" dependencies. See README for more information.
* [Fixed] Version badge showed a very old version. (Thanks Pavlos-Petros Tournaris!)

* [Fixed] Provide advice for source-containing root projects.
* [Fixed] Subtle bug that led to unused dependencies showing up in change-advice.

# Version 0.27.0
* There is no version 0.27.0, as there were issues with publishing to the Gradle Plugin Portal.
